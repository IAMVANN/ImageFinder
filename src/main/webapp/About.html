        <p class="lead text-muted">This project was super fun! I learned about web scrapping in Java and multithreading, but with that being said,
        there are a couple of things I regret doing. First, the way I handled exceptions was a bit inconsistent, making it hard for me to sometimes check if a
            exception was thrown or not in testing. To continue, I also regret not having enough time to write up mockito tests and test my classes in general.
            I was on a time crunch to begin with -I had a super busy week-, and so when I started having trouble testing, I opted to focus on developing my program
            and doing system testing instead. If this was a larger program, this will not do, but I think I was able to get away with it here with minimal bugs.
            The reason I had trouble testing was because I was having trouble with this version of mockito. I'm used to using the latest verison, and that always me to
            mock a larger variety of classes. In this version 2, it seems to have some trouble mocking some classes (EX. the provided setup test where it had trouble
            mocking HttpServletRequest. To continue, it also trouble mocking ConcurentHashMap and ThreadPoolExecutor)). Enough about my regrets though, Lets talk about what
            some additional features that I will consider adding in the future to improve this project-> I noticed that a lot of images don't have alt tags or a description of the image,
            so perhaps i can use the OpenAI API to generate a description of the image. I have experience working wtih the API, (if you are curious, I would love to tell you about the project I made
            HooGRADES). I can also add a feature that allows the user to download the images. With these new changes, I'm sure this project will be even more fun to use!
            Thanks for this project Eulerity! I had a lot of fun!
